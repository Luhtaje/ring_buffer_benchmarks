Sub directories of this  contains benchmark programs to test the thesis project of a dynamic ring buffer in C++.
The benchmarks are meant to test heap memory usage with valgrind massif and some performance bencmark tool. (To be decided)
These benchmarks have been written to primarily test the time performance of these containers and secondarily the memory usage will be logged and analyzed.
The topics have been chosen by listing the pro's and con's of each container and picking up the most common characteristics. 
In other words the benchmarks test what the existing containers are good or bad in.

Current topics to test the containers are:
Accessing elements: Random access (sequential and random), different size containers
                    Border access, different size containers.
